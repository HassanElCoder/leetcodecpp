# Binary Trees Questions


## Question 2.1
Given a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes’ values.
Recursive solution is trivial, you need to implement it iteratively.

## Question 2.2
Given inorder and postorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.

## Question 2.3
Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).
Assume a BST is defined as follows:
• The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node’s key.
• The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
• Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
